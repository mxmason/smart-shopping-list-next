				Hello from the home page, and welcome to your Collab Lab project! We've
				included a few distinct pages (also called views) to get the project
				started. You can use the nav bar to visit them, but you'll see that they
				don't do very much yet!
			</p>

				It'll be your job, alongside your team, to implement the features this
				app needs in order to become a working shopping list! Happy coding!
